# 🚀 Release Notes: DinamicHUD v1.2 (UX Improvements)

## 🌟 New Features
### **1. Optimized HUD Layout**
-   **Positions Adjusted**: Shifted HUD panels for fringe players (Left Top/Bottom and Right Top/Bottom) slightly inward (12.5% from edge).
    -   *Impact*: Prevents the HUD from being cut off by the screen edge or obscuring player avatars on 6-max tables.
    -   *Symmetry*: Both left and right sides are now perfectly symmetrical.

### **2. Personal Stats "Mini Mode" Upgrade**
-   **Background Refresh**: The "Update" action is now threaded, preventing the "Window Not Responding" freeze during database queries.
-   **Mini-Mode Access**: Added a **Refresh (⟳)** button directly to the minimized title bar. You no longer need to expand the window to update your stats.
-   **Visual Feedback**: added loading indicators ("⏳") to signal when data is being processed.

# 🚀 Release Notes: DinamicHUD v1.1 (EV & UI Update)

## 🌟 New Features
### **1. All-In EV Calculation & Graph**
-   **True EV Tracking**: The HUD now accurately calculates "All-In EV Adjusted" winnings.
    -   *Logic*: Uses Monte Carlo simulation to calculate equity when players go All-In before the river.
    -   *Graph*: The Yellow Line ("EV Adjusted") now correctly diverges from the Green Line ("Net Won") only when Luck aligns/misaligns with Expectation.
-   **Bug Fix (Null Handling)**: Fixed a critical bug where non-all-in hands were treated as "Zero EV" instead of "Realized EV", causing the graph line to crash.

### **2. Enhanced Stats Window**
-   **View Mode Selector**: Added a new dropdown in "My Stats" to toggle between:
    -   **Total ($)**: Absolute profit in Dollars.
    -   **Total (BB)**: Absolute profit in Big Blinds.
    -   **BB/100**: Winrate (Big Blinds per 100 hands).
-   **Dynamic Formatting**: Start/Win/Loss values are now color-coded (Green/Red) and formatted according to the selected mode.
-   **Unit Fix**: Fixed a calculation error where "EV BB/100" was previously displaying Dollars/100 instead of Blinds/100 (fixing the "50x smaller" discrepancy).

## 🛠 Technical Improvements
-   **Test Environment**: Created a permanent isolated testing suite (`run_tests.py`, `setup_test_env.py`) to verify EV logic without risking the main database.
-   **Clean Code**: Removed debug scripts and optimized `poker_stats_db.py` for better performance.
-   **Stability**: Fixed crashes related to "Card Identity" and `QObject` signal handling during startup.

## 📝 How to Use
1.  **Graph**: Simply verify that the Yellow line now looks realistic (smooth accumulation similar to Green line, diverging on All-Ins).
2.  **Stats**: Open "My Stats" -> Click the ComboBox next to the Graph button to switch between `$`, `BB`, and `BB/100`.
